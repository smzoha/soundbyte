# SoundByte

A java-based application which can be used to play audio files (generic types of .wav, .aac and .ogg, along with .mp3), along with the capability of recording audio clips, as well as editing the audio files. The application also allows for a playlist system, through which the users may store their playlist, as well as it edit it at their convinience.

The code is a very clumsy and rough one, considering this was one of my early university projects. The code can be built with `gradle jar`, and run through the .bat file created in the Build folder.

The following are the dependecies (libraries) that are required to compile and run the application. The .jar files that could not be referenced through a Gradle repository is included in the lib folder of the project.

* **MP3Library** by *Sun Microsystem* is used to ensure the playback of MP3 files in the application.

The dependency (library) listed above is licensed by it's respective owner and the terms and conditions were upheld while building this system.

The application itself, however, is licensed under GNU General Public License, version 3.0. A copy of the license can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html).

The application was coded in Eclipse, later migrated to IntelliJ to enable Gradle building.
